#Problem
You have been asked to handle the seating arrangements for the next dinner party of the
QUEEN'S Ultimately Exhausting Endlessly Nested Society (in which “QUEEN'S” stands for
“QUEEN'S Ultimately Exhausting Endlessly Nested Society” - it's the club for people who
love infinite recursion). The club has been wracked by political wrangling lately and a
number of deep personal conflicts have developed. You have a graph in which each person is
represented by a vertex, and edges represent personal conflicts. Vertices are connected by an
edge if the people they represent dislike each other so much they cannot possibly sit at the
same table. There are a lot of edges in the graph.

Part 2: Pseudo-Minimal Colouring
Even if two tables will not suffice, the treasurer still wants you to find a seating arrangement
that uses the minimal number of tables. Luckily you are able to convince him that finding the
minimal number of tables needed is a very difficult problem – its decision version is NPComplete,
so we don't believe there is any polynomial-time algorithm for it.
