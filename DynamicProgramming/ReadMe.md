#Problem
You have been hired on contract to lead a project team at Qooqle, a small but growing
software startup in Silicon Valley Far North (aka Qikiqtarjuaq, in Qikiqtaaluf). The fact that
your degree is from a university that starts with “Q” may have had something to do with the
hiring.
Qooqle has an abundance of potential projects for your team to work on. Each project
involves providing development and support to clients for specific periods of time.
There are too many projects to complete them all, so your first task is to select the projects
that your team will complete over the next n weeks. The company requires that you choose a
subset of the available projects to maximize the total of the billing fees that Qooqle
management has set for the projects.
Each project is characterized by three integers:
a start week – this is set by the client
the number of weeks the project will take – set by the client
and the amount of revenue the project will earn for the company – set by Qooqle
