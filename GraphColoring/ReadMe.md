#Problem
You have been asked to handle the seating arrangements for the next dinner party of the
QUEEN'S Ultimately Exhausting Endlessly Nested Society (in which “QUEEN'S” stands for
“QUEEN'S Ultimately Exhausting Endlessly Nested Society” - it's the club for people who
love infinite recursion). The club has been wracked by political wrangling lately and a
number of deep personal conflicts have developed. You have a graph in which each person is
represented by a vertex, and edges represent personal conflicts. Vertices are connected by an
edge if the people they represent dislike each other so much they cannot possibly sit at the
same table. There are a lot of edges in the graph.

Part 1: 2-Colouring
The treasurer of your club is a real cheapskate. He wants to rent as few tables as possible (all
tables cost the same to rent, regardless of size) so he wants you to find a way to seat all the
people using just two tables if possible.
